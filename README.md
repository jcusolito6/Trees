The purpose of this project was to teach us about Trees, specifically binary search trees. This application uses different methods of traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder) in order to collect summarized information about the tree. The way the application works is on the bottom you can set how big you want the tree to be (data size), click ‘Generate Data’ in the top-left, and then on the top there are 6 different buttons you can click that will give you different information about the tree, all which use a different type of traversal. You can get every path of the tree, get the parent of an inputted node, get the statistics of the tree etc. The main file for this is “BinarySearchTree.java”
